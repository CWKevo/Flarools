# Python web project template

A template for new Python web projects.

## Features

- Flask + FastAPI for backend; Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS for frontend;
- SQLModel for database;
- Flask-Login for user authentication, Flask-Babel for i18n;
- Everything works out of the box with best practices and is ready to be built upon;

## Your to-do list

- [ ] Edit `# FIXME` and `# TODO` lines to match your project;
- [ ] Setup virtualenv (`python -m venv env`);
- [ ] Rename `python_web_project_template` folder and start editing the source code;
  - [ ] Also run a global search/replace for `python_web_project_template` (trust me, it'll save you a lot of time and will prevent you from forgetting to edit it somewhere);
- [ ] Edit variables in `python_web_project_template/settings.py` and create `python_web_project_template/private_settings.py` (use template from `python_web_project_template/private_settings.template.py`);
- [ ] Add your dependencies to `requirements.txt`;
- [ ] Update .gitingore with your stuff;
- [ ] Replace this `README.md` file with a fancier one;
- [ ] Upload code to your GitHub repository;
- [ ] Add your editior's folder to `.gitignore`;

That should be it. Happy coding!
